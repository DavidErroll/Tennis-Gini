# Rafael Nadal's Grand Slam career is greater than Roger Federer's, or: The limits of data analysis

You may have missed the most divisive statistical analysis in tennis history when it landed last September.

That’s because it was published in The Economist, the venerable British publication that’s not exactly known for its sports coverage and whose online content resides behind a pay wall.

But the analysis did indeed happen, and the tennis fans who came upon it -- or at least half of them -- did not like what they found.

“You can skew results to ‘prove’ whatever you want,” carped one reader in the online comments section.

“Sorry,” offered another. “This logic does not make sense.”

[The comments](https://www.economist.com/node/21728882/comments) continued on and on, with some praising the article’s conclusion and others denigrating it.

The reason for the sharp divide in opinion: the subjects of the analysis were Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have the most debated, obsessed-over rivalry the sport has ever seen -- and the most dedicated fans. The premise of the article is perfectly captured in the headline: “Sorry, Roger: Rafael Nadal is not just the king of clay.”

The author, Jeff Sackman, argued that Nadal’s performance in tennis’ major tournaments represents a greater achievement than that of his rival. But rather than comparing Roger and Rafa by conventional methods -- number of Grand Slams won, say, or head-to-head match-ups in those events -- he used the statistical rating system known as “Elo” to determine the difficulty of their respective paths to victory at each major tournament they conquered.

The system attempts to quantify the quality of a champion’s victory at a tournament by crunching the numbers on the career won-loss records of both his opponents and his opponents’ opponents. It’s actually more complicated than that, including comparing Federer and Nadal’s title runs “to the last several decades of grand slams results,” but that’s the gist of it. You can try to find your way into The Economist article if you’d like a more robust explanation of the methodology.

As the headline of the article makes clear, Sackman’s Elo work found that Nadal overall has had a more difficult path to Grand Slam glory than Federer (albeit by a small degree) and thus his major titles as a whole mean more.

And now, in a blog post this week, Sackman has doubled down on his “difficulty-adjusted” Slam conclusion, even though Federer won his record-extending 20th major singles title in January, meaning he now has four more such championships than Nadal. Sackman’s headline: “Roger Federer’s 20th, Easiest Grand Slam Title.”

But first, back to The Economist article from last fall, when Federer had 19 majors to Nadal’s 16. Sackman argued that the draws they’ve faced during their respective Grand Slam tournament victories “have tended to benefit” Federer more than Nadal, since Nadal’s prime years tracked perfectly with those of two members of the so-called “Big Four”: Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Federer, at 36, is 4-5 years older than the other three top players.

“One of the best arguments left to Mr. Nadal's supporters is that Mr. Federer padded his statistics in the weak era of 2003-07, before Mr. Djokovic and Mr. Murray reached their primes, and when a young Mr. Nadal was primarily a threat on clay courts,” Sackman wrote. “The Swiss maestro enjoyed years swatting away lesser lights, whereas Mr. Nadal has spent much of his career doing battle with Mr. Djokovic and Mr. Murray.”

OK, let’s pause here. The “weak era” -- that old canard won’t die. Sackman’s Elo reaches this conclusion about Federer’s direct contemporaries, it seems, because the rating system is just math -- it doesn’t think. Lleyton Hewitt, who’s the same age as Federer, won two Grand Slam titles in his career. The 38-year-old Marat Safin also won two. Other top Federer contemporaries Andy Roddick, David Nalbandian and Nikolay Davydenko collectively won one -- namely, Roddick’s 2003 U.S. Open victory.

Why did these guys have such limited success at the major tournaments? It wasn’t because they weren’t first-rate tennis players. The powerful, athletic Safin won his first Grand Slam title at 20 by crushing all-time great Pete Sampras in the 2000 U.S. Open final. Early in Roddick’s career, his mammoth serve and forehand had commentators struggling to come up with historical comparisons. Davydenko has a winning career head-to-head record, 6-5, against Nadal.

No, these players -- along with the resurgent, late-career Andre Agassi -- usually came up short during the “weak era” because Federer at the top of his peak was all but untouchable.

Nadal, Djokovic and Murray, all supreme talents, eventually came along and successfully challenged Federer, to one degree or another. That’s quite true. But, by then, had age and wear-and-tear and family commitments brought Federer down off his mountaintop, just a little bit?

Maybe and maybe not. The time period of Federer’s true peak is debatable. And, undeniably, Nadal proved able, unlike anyone else (including Djokovic and Murray), to beat Federer right from the get-go -- and on any surface.

Still, the Elo rating, assuming we properly understand it (it’s math, so that’s a big assumption), appears to give Nadal a somewhat misleading boost because his best surface, by far, is clay. That’s important because this is a hard-court era: most of the top players are at their best on hard courts.

As a commenter on The Economist article put it: The analysis “probably grossly underestimated Nadal's chance of winning Roland Garros, given that the Elo rating is heavily skewed by matches on hard court, as it is the most common surface. As a result, his wins [at the French Open] were assigned more weight by this methodology.”

That makes sense. Yet, perhaps surprisingly, Elo seems to be a flawed way of looking at things even when it’s narrowed down to one particular playing surface. Consider Sackman’s analysis this week of Federer’s path to the 2018 Australian Open crown, the Swiss great’s 20th major victory. He writes that, according to “surface-specific” Elo, “the toughest challenge Federer faced last month was Tomas Berdych, closely followed by Marin Cilic.”

Huh? Berdych has never won a major championship and, at 32, is on the downside of his career, having dropped out of the Top 10. (He topped out at No. 4 in 2015 and is now ranked 17th.) Cilic is the 2014 U.S. Open champion and, at 29, is arguably playing the best sustained tennis of his life, having made the final at last year’s Wimbledon and then reached the final last month in Melbourne. He is now ranked third in the world. (Wimbledon is played on grass, which presumably means Cilic’s impressive result there does not count toward his “surface-specific” Elo on the Australian Open’s hard courts.)

Here’s another hint that all is not well in Elo-land: Sackman writes that both Federer and Nadal had easy-breezy runs to their last major titles, Federer at January’s Australian Open and Nadal at 2017’s U.S. Open, but that at least “Nadal had to get past Juan Martin del Potro in New York.”

It’s hard to know what he means by that. Del Potro won the 2009 U.S. Open, five years before Cilic won the same tournament. DelPo is a great champion, but Sackman doesn’t point out that the big Argentine, after years of injuries, isn’t the same player who ended Federer’s five-year run of titles in New York. Or that, after an epic, five-set, come-from-behind victory over Dominic Thiem in the fourth round of the 2017 U.S. Open, followed by four tough sets against Federer, he was gassed by the time he faced Nadal in the semifinals.

All of that said, Federer’s 20th major, even though it was his “easiest,” still somehow moved him up the Elo “difficulty-adjusted” ranking -- for now, that is. “If Nadal stays healthy and wins the French Open,” Sackman wrote this week, “he is virtually guaranteed to reclaim the difficulty-adjusted crown, and by a wider margin than Roger currently holds.”

There you have it: Elo is a fickle mistress. We’re not sure we understand the statistical analysis (OK, we’re certain we don’t understand it). But this much we do know: regardless of who wins the 2018 French Open, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will remain universally and rightfully acknowledged as all-time greats -- and Federer will still hold the record for most major singles championships.
